"description": "Hi folks! This is HackED's official **HitchHacker's Guide To The Galaxy**. Contained in this channel is everything you'll need to get the most out of your hackathon experience, as well as the answers to a lot of questions you might have throughout the hackathon; it's a reference for safety information, the event schedule, project guidelines, submission instructions, and more.

Please use the search function or the links provided to navigate the Guide (and, if you have any questions that aren't answered, ask us in <#1187244568538787922>!",

- HackED has absolutely zero tolerance for violence or threats to other participants.
### `Transit`
- For your safety, participants are **strongly discouraged from leaving the event in the middle of the night**.
- Edmonton public transit routes stop running at some point during the night. If you do plan to take transit home late at night, please **make sure your route is still running**. More information about exact times for individual routes can be found [here](https://www.edmonton.ca/sites/default/files/public-files/assets/transit/ETS-Route-Frequency-Table-Sept-2023.pdf).
- The University of Alberta's Safewalk program will not be running during the event, as it is a weekend.
- For a safe ride home, dial #TAXI on your cell phone.
### `Food & Drink`
- HackED aims to promote healthy work habits and environments. We ask participants to **prioritize their own mental and physical health** as much as possible, above hackathon participation or projects.
- Staying well-fed and hydrated are important! Please take time to eat and drink water throughout the event. 
  - We will provide **snacks** throughout the event and **dinner** on Saturday.
  - There is a water fountain available at our in-person location on DICE 8F. 
  - Participants are also encouraged to bring what they need to eat for as long as they plan to stay on-campus.",

{
"title": "`Judging Signup Details`",
"description": "To sign up for judging, run the </judging_signup:> command in **your team's text channel**. If your team does not run this command, you will not be registered for judging and will not be eligible for *any* prizes.

The command allows you to select up to 3 challenges: `challenge1`, `challenge2`, and `challenge3`.
- At least 1 of the challenges you select must be `Main HackED`, which signs you up for the main HackED competition.
- In general, teams may select only 1 other challenge; so you will be specifying 2 challenges in the command (`Main HackED` and your challenge of choice).
- A special case is when you are signing up for both one of the MecSimCalc challenges and one of the Engineering Department challenges, in which case you will be specifying 3 challenges in the command (`Main HackED`, a MecSimCalc challenge, and an Engineering Department challenge).

You also must declare a medium preference using the `medium_preference` argument.
- This may be either `online` (in which case we will *try to* put your team in a room with judges attending virtually) or `in-person` (in which case we will *try to* put your team in a room with in-person judges).
- There is *no guarantee* that selecting `online` means you will be put with online judges, or that selecting `in-person` means you will be put with in-person judges; this is dependent on our judges' availability and practical constraints.
- Regardless of whether you are put with online or in-person judges, *both online and in-person teams will be able to present*. The medium preference is only a preference; both online and in-person judges will be able to judge online and in-person teams.

Finally, you must submit a link to your Github repository and DevPost project using the `github_link` and `devpost_link` arguments.
- If you are signing up towards the beginning of the event, it is totally acceptable to submit an empty/template Github and DevPost.
- However, the links you submit must be updated with your actual project code and information before the judging signup deadline. We will use these links as our official record of your project.
- See the [Project Submission Details](https://discord.com/channels/1179492116334919710/1179497189765038191/1190362760920449095) for more information on requirements for the Github and DevPost.

For example...
- To sign up for general HackED judging with no challenges, run: </judging_signup:> `Main HackED`
- To sign up for the DivE challenge (which also enters a team for the general HackED judging), run: </judging_signup:> `Main HackED` `DivE`
- To sign up for the MecSimCalc Maps challenge and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering challenge, run: </judging_signup:> `Main HackED` `MecSimCalc Maps` `Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering`
- **To unregister from judging**, run </judging_signup:> with no other arguments.",
