**To create a team, use the </team:1191596869877510275> command.** For example, to create a team named `1337-h4xx0rz` with the members <@366769320275083276> and <@1188682152020279429>, I would run this command:

</team:1191596869877510275> 1337-h4xx0rz <@366769320275083276> <@1188682152020279429>

`Team composition information:`
- Teams may have anywhere from 1 to 5 members, inclusive.
- Teams may consist of any combination of in-person/virtual participants.

`Command information:`
- The `team_name` parameter should be your team name, which may only consist of **lowercase letters** and **digits** separated by **dashes**. Some examples of valid team names: `a-hacked-team`, `team-1`, `hackathon-winners`.
- The `member*` parameters should be **mentions** of each person on the team.

If you want to add/remove members from your team after it is created, please ping <@366769320275083276>.",
