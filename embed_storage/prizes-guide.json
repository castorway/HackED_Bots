This challenge is brought to you in collaboration with [AltaML](https://altaml.com/) and the [Student Innovation Centre](https://www.ualberta.ca/student-innovation-centre/index.html).*
### `CRITERIA`
- `FAIRNESS:` Ensure model fairness across diverse demographics, mitigate biases, and prioritize explainability in content flagging decisions.
- `SOCIAL IMPACT:` Teams should aim to not only develop innovative applications but also ensure that the AI models are accountable, ethical, and serve the best interests of users and society as a whole.
- `RESOURCEFULNESS:` Teams are encouraged to utilize existing solutions rather than building/training models from scratch given the time constraint.
- `ACCESSIBILITY:` Teams are encouraged to design/build the user interface in a way that the tool is easy to use.
### `REQUIREMENTS`
- To win a prize for this challenge, you must:
  1. Be a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, or on refugee status.
  2. Have opted in using the form that was sent out and *received a response confirming your acceptance*. Only the first 70 submissions will be accepted.
  3. Be on a team that selects the AltaML Challenge when you sign up for judging.
  4. Build a project that *attempts to satisfy the problem statement* and present your project during the judging period.
- Note that prizes for this challenge are awarded to *individual participants*, not teams. If a team selects this challenge but only some of the participants were accepted via the form, **only those participants will receive the prize**.
