### `PROBLEM STATEMENT`
Develop a content moderation tool for social media platforms that utilizes GPT or builds upon any existing models to detect and flag hate speech, misinformation, and harmful content.
### `CRITERIA`
- `FAIRNESS:` Ensure model fairness across diverse demographics, mitigate biases, and prioritize explainability in content flagging decisions.
- `SOCIAL IMPACT:` Teams should aim to not only develop innovative applications but also ensure that the AI models are accountable, ethical, and serve the best interests of users and society as a whole.
- `RESOURCEFULNESS:` Teams are encouraged to utilize existing solutions rather than building/training models from scratch given the time constraint.
- `ACCESSIBILITY:` Teams are encouraged to design/build the user interface in a way that the tool is easy to use.
### `REQUIREMENTS`
1. Be a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, or on refugee status.
2. Opt in with [the signup form](https://forms.gle/FMZXSbzGU9zkDW626) and *receive a response confirming your acceptance*. Only the first 72 valid submissions will be accepted.
3. Be on a team that selects the AltaML Challenge during judging signups.
4. **Build a project** that satisfies the *problem statement and the 4 criteria* and **present your project** for judging.
Prizes for this challenge are awarded to *individual participants*, not teams. If a team selects this challenge but only some members were accepted, **only those members will receive the prize**. Prizes are awarded to all participants satisfying the requirements, not based on which teams win or rank highest.
