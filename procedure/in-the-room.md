# Exec-in-the-room

- When a team gets to the room and starts presenting, ping the room channel.
  - Make a note of the *team name* and also *project name* so we can identify their DevPost. If you get a chance, find their actual project on DevPost and make a note of it in the Discord.
- If a team member disconnects due to technical issues during presentation, have them reconnect to *their team VC* and use `~vcpull room_id team_name` (team name important) to bring them back. Or just do it manually.
- When a team finishes presenting and you're ready for the next team, ping the room channel.
